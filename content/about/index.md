Hello there! I'm Ali Almohaya aka almo7aya, I work as a senior web engineer @ [anghami](https://anghami.com).

I spend my whole day, practically every day:

Coding, fixing, refactoring, and modifying html, css, javascript frameworks, and libraries, I work with angular, react/nextjs, expressjs, electron, native browser APIs, javascript bundlers, and wherever javascript runs;

Fighting rust's borrow checker by building CLI tools, WebAssembly, WebGL, and GUI projects that are blazingly fast;

Configuring, testing, and building neovim plugins written in lua, speed, and extendability were never an option to me; 
check my [config](https://github.com/Almo7aya/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/lvim/config.lua)

Fixing broken github actions workflows, configuring nginx proxies, and writing docker-compose.yml files;

Exploring github repositories searching for interesting projects, maintaining my open-source [projects](https://github.com/almo7aya), and giving back by contributing to open-source projects that I find interesting;

Reading a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds and Wikipedia pages;

Reverse-engineering apps and dealing with millions of bytecode lines just for the sake of it;

In a nutshell, I build websites, apps, libraries, and plugins that are robust and reliable. I do it well.
