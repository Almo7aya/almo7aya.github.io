3 minute read</div></div></header><div class=content itemprop=articleBody><h2 id=why>Why</h2><p>I have been thinking about creating a personal website for myself to show my projects and to write about the interesting stuff I found online, and maybe to write some blogs about my learnings and the other tools that I&rsquo;m using on my daily basis.</p><h2 id=static-site-generator>Static Site Generator</h2><p>This is what took me so long to create personal website, I always wanted a to create a website for me, but every time I get stuck because I didn&rsquo;t feel the static generator is good enough.</p><p>So in the last week I almost tried all the static generators out there eg: <a href=https://jekyllrb.com/>Jekyll</a>, <a href=https://hexo.io/>Hexo</a>, <a href=https://github.com/11ty/eleventy>Eleventy</a>, and many others, and I ended up using <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> as a static site generator for my website, It&rsquo;s written in go, so it&rsquo;s light and fast, and very easy to get started with, the documentations is good and I didn&rsquo;t face any issue setting it up.</p><h2 id=theming>Theming</h2><p>This part is best part of the process, after I was sure about using <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> I started searching for a theme from the <a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/>list on Hugo&rsquo;s website</a>, and found some beautiful themes, but most of them are not perfect for me, I wanted something very simple, and makes you feel like the you are inside terminal, I got inspired by <a href=https://blog.sachaos.dev/>@sachaos</a>&rsquo;s website, and decided to edit one of Hugo&rsquo;s themes, so I forked <a href=https://github.com/monkeyWzr/hugo-theme-cactus>hugo-theme-cactus</a> and added my <a href=https://github.com/Almo7aya/hugo-theme-cactus>changes</a> on top of it, I didn&rsquo;t think about someone using my fork so I didn&rsquo;t add any configurations for the things I added and removed some of its main layouts and finally I took the last inspiration for the header from <a href=https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal>hugo-theme-terminal</a>, and I changed some of the css properties to disable the ToC and the floating actions icons they didn&rsquo;t work right and they were not that responsive.</p><h2 id=hosting-deployment-and-using-custom-domain>Hosting, Deployment and using custom domain</h2><p>I use <a href=https://github.com/features/actions>GitHub Actions</a> to build the website, and <a href=https://pages.github.com/>GitHub Pages</a> to host it, Hugo has a nice <a href=https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/>Action</a> to automatically build and deploy the project on GitHub Pages when every there is a new commit in the main branch, here is my action workflow file <a href=https://github.com/Almo7aya/almo7aya.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/hugo-deploy-to-gh-page.yml>hugo-deploy-to-gh-page.yml</a>.</p><p>By default the website will be hosted on <a href=almo7aya.github.io>almo7aya.github.io</a> and it needs some configurations to work on my domain <a href=almo7aya.dev>almo7aya.dev</a>, GitHub Pages requires the custom domain to have a CNAME DNS record pointing to the gh page&rsquo;s URL which is almo7aya.github.io in my case
<img src=/images/2022-10-05_08-03.png alt="CNAME RECORD">
after that I added it to the repo pages settings as a custom domain
<img src=/images/2022-10-05_08-09.png alt="GITHUB CUSTOM DOMAIN">
and now my website is live on almo7aya.dev.</p><p>As a side note Hugo&rsquo;s gh action will clean the gh-pages branch on every deploy and that causes gh pages to remove the custom domain,
To fix this I created a file called <code>/static/CNAME</code> and put inside my custom domain so it does not get removed by the action.</p><p>I&rsquo;m satisfied with this workflow it&rsquo;s fast and fully automated, regardless of gh pages has a native support for Jekyll to auto build and deploy, Jekyll was a nightmare to run locally on my MacBook with M1 chip, since it&rsquo;s written in ruby and it&rsquo;s not compatible with the pre-installed ruby version on my Mac I had to run it inside a docker container to escape from the compatibility issues, and I was not convinced enough to keep developing it inside a container.</p><h2 id=plugins>Plugins</h2><p>I only have one plugin which is <a href=https://utteranc.es/>utteranc</a> to add comments to my posts, It uses github issues to store and manage the comments, setting it up was easy, just installed it on the website&rsquo;s repo and linked it in the Hugo config file.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Creating this project was fun, I learned so much stuff about Static Site Generators, markdown, ruby, and github APIs.</p></div></article><div class=blog-post-comments><div id=disquss_thread><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=almo7aya/almo7aya.github.io issue-term=pathname label=almo7aya.dev theme=github-dark crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div></div></div><footer id=footer><img id=image src=/images/avatar.jpg alt><div class=name>üìçüáæüá™</div><div class=name>Ali Almohaya</div><div class=link>GitHub: <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/almo7aya>@almo7aya</a></div><div class=link>Twitter: <a target=_blank href=https://twitter.com/@almo7aya_>@almo7aya_</a></div><div class=link>LinkedIn: <a target=_blank href=https://linkedin.com/in/almo7aya>Ali Almohaya</a></div><div class=link><a target=_blank href=mailto:alialmohaya@gmail.com>alialmohaya@gmail.com</a></div><div class=link><a target=_blank href=/index.xml>rss</a></div><div class=license>Licensed under a <a target=_blank href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC Attribution 4.0
